Grading Level: Same grade for all members

Differences:
In the Applciation idea paper we noted that the user will need to "Press a button to segue to main view" while they are viewing the logo. It is more visually appealing and less user interaction for it to auto segue to either the login screen if they aren't logged in, or to the main app if they are authenticated.

Special Instructions:
1. If you create an account and log into the app, then close and re-open the app, it will rembemer your authentication state and instead of going back to the login/regisitation screen it will connect you to the app.

2. We got started a little early on some beta stuff, while it is on the story board it is not accessable to the user yet.
