Implementation Contributions:
Henry Kim - 
John Madden - 
Matt Davidson - Created this readme. Worked on debugging issues Such as: 1. not being able to laod http or https pages if the certificate was not valid 2. An issue where the ratings system was not updating on the database half of the time 3. The index of the location was not updating properly after loading the map UI.Created the favorite system algorithm, which was coded by Henry. Fixed a few  UI constraints. 

Grading Level: Same grade for all members.

Differences:
One of the questions that was asked in our presentation is "Can users flip the switch to change if a location has outlets or not", this was not the intended function of the app and the UI was missleading by using switches. Because of this, we are now using "check" and "x" indicators to denote whether a location has a "feature" or not. 

Special Instructions:
Only @utexas email accounts will be able to rate (as noted on the app idea paper).
